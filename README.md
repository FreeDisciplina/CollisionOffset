# Experiments on the Distribution of Offsets of Collisions #

This program check the distribution of offsets of collisions on the computation chains when searching for collisions.
The setting is as follows: we evaluate <MATH>2<sup>t</MATH> chains of length <MATH>2<sup>s</MATH> by iterating an <MATH>n</MATH>-bit random mapping <MATH>f</MATH>. At each offset on the computation chain, there might be some collisions. A question is "How is the collisions distributed along the chains". To answer this question, we perform experiments counting the number of collisions on each offset.

## Experiments ##

We simulate the <MATH>n</MATH>-bit random mapping <MATH>f</MATH> using chopped AES-128 (obtained by fixing an arbitrary key and <MATH>128-n</MATH> bits of the input and take <MATH>n</MATH> bits as the output, where <MATH>n</MATH> is in {12, ..., 32}). We check the distribution of collision offsets in the following cases:
- Case 1: <MATH>t + 2s > n</MATH>, in particular
  + \#define s ((n + 3) / 4)
  + \#define t (2 * (n + 2) / 3) 
- Case 2: <MATH>t + 2s < n</MATH>, in particular
  + \#define s ((n + 7) / 8)
  + \#define t ((n + 2) / 3)  
  (in this particular case, no collisions is found because it requires <MATH>2t + s >= n</MATH> to find the same-offset collision)
- Case 3: <MATH>t + 2s</MATH> slightly larger or less than <MATH>n</MATH>, in particular
  + \#define s ((n + 7) / 8)
  + \#define t (5 * s)
- Case 4: <MATH>t + 2s</MATH> almost equals to <MATH>n</MATH>, in particular
  + \#define s ((n + 3) / 4)
  + \#define t ((n + 1) / 2)

We directly use implementations of AES-128 included in IPPCP (Cryptography for Intel Intergrated Performance Primitives) in IPP (Intel Integrated Performance Primitives). Thus, one may need to install [IPP](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-ipp) and [IPPCP](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-ipp-cryptography-libraries) to compile and run this experiment.

- This program has been tested on the following platforms:
  + Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.10.0-33-generic x86_64) + g++ (GCC) 5.4.0 + icpc (ICC) 17.0.4

- Compiling:
  + two parameters can be defined manually during compiling:
     * `nmin`: the minimum value of <MATH>n</MATH> (default 12)
     * `nmax`: the maximum value of <MATH>n</MATH> (default 32)
  + two parameters must be defined in the source file [declares.h](https://github.com/FreeDisciplina/CollisionOffset/blob/master/declares.h)
     * `t`: the binary logarithm of the number of evaluated chains
     * `s`: the binary logarithm of the length of evaluated chains
  + example:
     * > make 
     * > make nmin=12 nmax=28

## Results ##

As pointed out by authors in [DL16](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01407953/document), when <MATH>t + 2s <= n</MATH>, each evaluated chain is not expected to collide with more than one different chain. In this case, the collision offset is roughly uniformly distributed in the interval <MATH>[0, 2<sup>s]</MATH>. On the other hand, when <MATH>t + 2s > n</MATH>, there is an obvious decrease on the number of collisions with the increase of offsets. Note that, there is a more obvious decrease on the number of images with the increase of offsets (due to the entropy loss phenomenon).

The following figures show examples of the results obtained in Case 1: <MATH>t + 2s > n</MATH>, from which we can see the obvious decrease on the number of collisions with the increase of offsets when <MATH>t + 2s</MATH> is larger than <MATH>n</MATH> (plotted using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)):

The following figures show examples of the results obtained in Case 3: <MATH>t + 2s</MATH> slightly larger or less than <MATH>n</MATH>, from which we can see the decrease (resp. roughly uniformly distribution) of the number of collisions with the increase of offsets when <MATH>t + 2s</MATH> is slightly larger than (resp. less than) <MATH>n</MATH> (plotted using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)):
